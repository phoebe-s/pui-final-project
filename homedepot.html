        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>Innovate upon a product-service system with a service that enhances the customer shopping experience by creating value.</p>

            <h4>My Role</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>Made movie for customers and pitched to our client Home Depot</p>
        </div>

            <h4>Problem Space</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>Many customers spend an unnecessary amount of time waiting for an associate to get the help that can be found through using the mobile application. Thus, Home Depot could facilitate a faster customer shopping experience by making the application more accessible in-store. Value would be created for Home Depot through an increased turnover rate and more time spent on meaningful customer interactions.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <h4>Background Research</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>We devised a research plan to guide us through contextual inquiries to consolidate the key information that we wanted to generate insights from. The high-level goal of these interviews was to get a sense of the current service ecosystem at Home Depot. We then travelled to the Home Depot location in East Liberty (PA) to take a look around the store and talk to various store associates and customers. Over the course of multiple visits to this location, we interacted with seven customers and four associates.</p>
            <p>Through these interviews with various customers and store associates, we gleaned two key insights:</p>
            <p>Customers expect associates to be able to answer various questions about the products; but in practice, the burden of knowledge is often on the customer as associates aren’t always knowledgeable in every department.</P>
            <p>The most common source of frustration for customers is when associates are unable or unwilling to help with their needs.</p>
            <p>With this key information, we created three personas that represented the customer base, as well as problem spaces that we would explore further as we narrow our scope.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>Since one of our potential points of interest was to introduce an in-store kiosk, we looked into other customer service-focused establishments such as Macy’s and Target to observe how they have implemented their kiosk features. These observations gave us inspiration for what content our kiosk should made available to Home Depot customers.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <h4>Conceptual Modeling</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>After we identified the problem, we generated ten different service solutions. We focused on the interactions between a customer and an associate (whether that be redirected in-person help or a virtual guide), as well as tackled different aspects of the cradle-to-grave principle in several variations of our potential solution.</p>
            <p>After a critique session with Home Depot in which we pitched our various solutions, we decided to discard most of the ideas from the first round of ideations and focus more on how customer needs are met—particularly the customer-associate interaction and how customers choose and use products. Our concept is to place the app in front of the customer via a kiosk so that simple questions are answered by themselves, and in return, frees up time for associates to have more meaningful interactions with customers.</p>
            <p>The kiosk will be a basic tablet-based system, which is preferable due to its versatility and low cost. Its content will be based on the already existing Home Depot tablet app, but limited to in-store shopping support. This means that unnecessary functions such as checkout and online delivery would be removed. Instead, an additional kiosk-exclusive function that connects the customer to an associate would be included. There will also be a QR code placed on the kiosk to encourage the consumer to download the mobile app.</p>
            <p>Installation will be done so that there are preventative measures against misuse and theft, overhead insurance that must be considered, and physical mobility in order to adapt to changing traffic situations throughout the day or week. The kiosk would be located near the entrance between every other aisle. We hypothesize that the increase in the mobile app user base will eventually decrease and stabilize the demand for the kiosk, which would minimize the amount needed per store. Other factors to consider are the size of the establishment, traffic within the store, and historical purchase data. Maintenance must be performed to keep the kiosk charged, clean, and checked for any malfunction. Integration of the communication between the kiosk and store associate would be through already existing FIRST phones that associates use.</p>

            <h4>Customer Journey Mapping</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>Before the solution, we illustrated two edge use cases. In the first use case, the customer waited for a long time for the associate. In the second use case, the customer connected with the wrong associate and spent more time to connect with the right one. For each use case, we found that there existed many unnecessary interactions that were time-consuming, which is a huge opportunity gap for our kiosk solution.</p>
            <p>With the kiosk embedded in the store, we illustrated the new user journey map. The new solution reduced the steps for a customer to connect with the right associate, thus enhancing the shopping experience from both sides.</p>

            <h4>Poster Iterations</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>We started with digital sketches to explore different ideas. Initially, we wanted to present the problem space that we identified and the solution on the poster. We also wanted to put some detailed information like the installation and location of the kiosk.</p>
            <p>With every iteration of the poster design, we aimed for a strong visual hierarchy and usage of language that the customer would understand, as the poster was directed towards the average customer who walks into the store. We looked for the best way to explain the service in a simplified and efficient manner, as well as empathize with common customer shopping challenges.</p>

            <h4>Final Pitch</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>We created our presentation as a visual aid to pitch to Home Depot representatives. We explained the usefulness of the existing mobile application despite the small user base, and then shared insights from our research. Then, we proposed our solution of the self-help kiosk and emphasized the value created for Home Depot. We talked about how our solution would seamlessly integrate into the existing service system.</p>

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>To effectively connect with the audience, we need to explicitly establish the target audience and what they need to know. Then, we need to decide the best method to communicate this information. In addition, when working on a client project, it is important to thoroughly research what was already been done by the corporate initiatives in order to avoid redundancy. We can easily fall into a situation in which we want to cover as many touch points as possible within a single service. However, focusing on just one point can effectively impact the entire service.</p>
