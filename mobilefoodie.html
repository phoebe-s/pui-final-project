            <h4>Goal</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>Create a functional prototype of a search application that personalizes results based on the consumer’s profile to suit his or her needs.</p>

            <h4>My Role</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>I met with my team to brainstorm and work on the iterations, and I received in-class critique from professors and peers.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <h4>Problem Space</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>After splitting up to interview various nearby food truck customers and employees, we gathered together our insights on post-it notes which we then arranged into an empathy map.</p>
            <p>From our combined experiences with various stakeholders, our key findings are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All stakeholders want experimentation with recipes and high-quality food.</li>
                <li>Owners and employees crave an ability to design and make a variety of dishes in their area of expertise.</li>
                <li>Customers called “foodies” want to try the newest trending food and share their opinions within their communities.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <h4>Storyboard</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>We worked on various storyboards to choose a problem space that we wanted to explore a solution within. The one shown below best matches the needs of the customer that we identified: the several different problems of truck quality, dietary restrictions, food quality, affordability, and efficiency are optimized. However, we needed to further explore the “why” behind the customer’s actions and decisions.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <h4>Initial Wireframes</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>After brainstorming the type of content we wanted to include in our application, we created wireframes on the board along with group discussion to decide the user flow. Upon agreeing on a finalized version, we moved the content onto a digital surface to present in a class critique.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <h4>Critique Takeaways</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>There was no strong differentiation from typical restaurant websites and the content did not fully address the goal of experimentation. With this in mind, we based our new designs on a new empathy map of foodie goals and key user stories to meet those needs.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <h4>Customer Journey Mapping</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>Because our target stakeholder, the food truck consumer, would more likely use the application on a mobile device, we wanted to work on a version for the mobile platform before drafting a desktop version.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>We provided users with three main tasks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find a food truck based on your preferences and choose a dish that you might like from the menu.</li>
                <li>Follow the Guide Me function and find a food truck that you want to go to.</li>
                <li>View the profile page and accept one suggestion from the taste breaker.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After the first round of user testing, we noted points of confusion within our screen designs. Some of the features were not intuitive to follow, such as finding the reviews and how to view more information regarding a dish. The user flow was not as feed-forward as we had thought, so we made a note to redesign some of the processes so that the user can be easily guided towards finding dishes.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <h4>Mobile Low-Fi Prototypes</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>We restructured several core features of our product: recommendation and guidance, authenticity information for each food, and rewards for trying different food. With these features, we integrated them into a new version that includes: a card view of daily recommendations, tags for preference settings, wishlists for collecting interesting dishes, customer scores and comments on authenticity, and medals to reward achievements for trying new cuisines.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <h4>Desktop Low-Fi Prototypes</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>With the mobile version of the application established, we started moving the content onto a desktop version as well. We chose to show preferences after the user first signs up to prompt him or her to give more information about their recommendations. “Have been to” serves a similar function to the geotagging feature on the mobile version. Clicking it allows for the user to leave a review. Having more whitespace on the desktop version allows for more filter selections to be displayed on the left side, as well as food truck hours and location to be listed below the featured dishes. We made these design decisions in favor of reducing the number of clicks the user has to make.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <h4>2nd Round Usability Testing</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>After a second round of testing our prototypes with several pilot users, we made further refinements with both the mobile and desktop versions. With the desktop version, we made alignment adjustments and included extra information to clarify reviewer credibility. In addition, we modified both versions to keep the theme and color palette consistent on both platforms to lessen user confusion when transitioning between devices to access the site.</p>
